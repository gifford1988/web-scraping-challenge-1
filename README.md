In this assignment, I used an application that scrapes websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in an HTML webpage.

I did the webscraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. I then used MongoDB in conjuction with Flask to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped.
